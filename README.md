# Flashcard-o-Matic!
## A demonstration of advanced React.js app-building in the form of a popular self-study tool.

Flashcard-o-matic helps students study online. Teachers can use this application to create decks of flashcards for the subjects they teach, and students will study the decks. Cards can be added, edited or even deleted. Same goes for decks. The power of knowledge is in your hands.

This project is designed to demonstrate my ability to work with rendering and state management using React, including the following:

- Installing packages via NPM
- Running tests from the command line
- Writing React function components
- Creating routes, including nested routes, using React Router
- Using hooks like useState(), useParams(), and useHistory()
- Debugging React code through console output and using the VS Code debugger
